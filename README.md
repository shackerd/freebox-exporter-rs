## Building, debugging, configuring project

### Clone project

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/shackerd/freebox-exporter-rs.git && cd freebox-exporter-rs
```

### Configuration

Actually `data_dir` folder is set to my home directory, you need to change it in configuration file (`conf.toml`) to get it working properly.

``` toml
[api]
host = "mafreebox.freebox.fr"
port = 443
refresh_interval_secs = 5
use_discovery = false
expose = { connection = true,  settings = true, contacts = true, calls = true, explorer = true, downloader = true, parental = true, pvr = true }

[core]
data_dir = "<your path>"
port = 9102
```

### Run debug configuration, assuming application is registered on Freebox host

``` bash
cargo run serve
```

### Register application if application is not registered on Freebox host

``` bash
cargo run register
```

### Running tests

> [!TIP]
> This project uses [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) for API mocking, you need to install GUI or CLI and start it with `api-mock.json` file.

Then run the following command.

``` bash
cargo test
```

### Verify it works

If you changed port in `conf.toml`, update the command line below.

``` bash
curl http://localhost:9102/metrics
```
