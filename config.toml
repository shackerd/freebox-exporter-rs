[api]
# Acceptable values: "router" or "bridge"
# These values will determine whether use discovery or not, see: https://github.com/shackerd/freebox-exporter-rs/issues/2#issuecomment-2234856496
# * discovery on:
#   * Traffic will be using host like xxxxxxxx.fbxos.fr
#   * FQDN resolves to your public IP address.
#   * However, you do not need to activate remote_access from local network to get API working.
# * discovery off:
#   * Traffic will be using host mafreebox.freebox.fr
#   * FQDN resolves to a public IP address (not yours), which allows you to reach your freebox API even if it's set to bridge mode.
# Remark: setting bridge as value works for both freebox mode router & bridge
mode = "bridge"

# Refresh wait interval in seconds, application will send requests to the freebox host on each refresh iteration
# This does not affect prometheus scrap agents, application will use cached values between calls
# Remark:
#   more you set API exposition (c.f: [publish] section) more requests will be sent,
#   setting a too low interval between refreshs could lead to request rate limiting from freebox host
